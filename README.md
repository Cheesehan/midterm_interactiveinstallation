# midterm_interactiveinstallation
This is our midterm project for Interactive Installation class.
I choose to stay on sound for midterm, since I always see sound as a essential and foundamental element in our life. 
We cannot see our own faces, but we can hear our voices everyday.
However, we are so used to say something to other people, we rarely talk to ourselves.
This is also a part and an experiment of my final project.
