# midterm_interactiveinstallation
This is our midterm project for Interactive Installation class.
I choose to stay on sound for midterm, since I always see sound as a essential and foundamental element in our life. 
We cannot see our own faces, but we can hear our voices everyday.
However, we are so used to say something to other people, we rarely talk to ourselves.
This is also a part and an experiment of my final project.
I use the zone difference to detect the movement of your body, or basically anything.
For the vocal remix part, it took me a while to figure out how to remix vocal into a smooth fake sound, I use phasor there to get everything good to go.

You may need an arduino kit to control the arduino part. 
-Try to make little noise when play with the looping part, and as for the real-time vocal part, try say the things you always want to say to yourself.
-Play with the drum using any part of your body.
-Close your eyes, and get ready to see your inner world, talk to it, complain with it, laught at it, do whatever you want.
